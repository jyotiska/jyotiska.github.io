<p>Blogging is hard. At first, you will come up with a lot of ideas, but it is difficult keep up and produce quality posts. I have made quite a few attempts to blog, but most of them did not work out. If you are a tech guy, you will have a plethora of options to choose a blogging platform. There are popular websites which can host your blog and provide a WYSIWYG editor for writing. Popular options are Wordpress, Blogger, Medium, Svbtle etc. They come up with a bunch of options, plugins, themes and lots of customization. There are few options which lets you host a blogging engine or a static site generator on your own server and lets you create contents. Popular options in these segments are - Jekyll, Hugo, Ghost, Octopress etc. For me all these choices imposed a decision fatigue. I had a couple of blogs back in the day in Wordpress and they were okay. I used to change theme every few weeks and did lots of customization. After that I used Jekyll based solution to host my blog in Github Pages. This worked well for an year, but created some issues when I switched my laptop and in the new laptop there were dependency issues with Ruby gems. Finally, I had created a blog in Medium. Within a few months, I grew tired of the restriction Medium imposes on you. I had to create my own solution.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/jyotiska/minni">minni</a>. It is a tiny static site generator written in 70 lines of Python that lets me create new blog posts, generate a new index file every time I create a new posts and generates static HTML files that I can deploy easily using Github Pages. minni is my own solution and I seriously doubt it will be useful for anyone else. While choosing minni, I had to settle with some restrictions -
<ul>
    <li>I will edit the HTML file directly to create or edit my contents, instead of using a Markdown file and convert that to HTML. This is fine since most of my posts are text heavy.</li>
    <li>There won't be a comment section using Disqus or any other technology. Since the post will be submitted to some forum such as Hacker News or Reddit, all discussions can take place there.</li>
    <li>No JavaScript (except Google Analytics) or shiny CSS. This will help the page load faster.</li>
    <li>No tag system for blog posts.</li>
    <li>No themes. The default one is good enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far this has worked out pretty well. The page is responsive and can be read well from a mobile device. It scores well on Google PageSpeed Insight. Also it gives me great relief in just writing a post and be done with it. I hope this post should resonate with some readers. I had planning to do this for a long time and finally got around finishing it. Thanks to <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this page</a> for being an inspiration to the layout. Enjoy your day!</p>
