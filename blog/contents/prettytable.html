<p><em>prettytable</em> is a popular Python package that lets you create beautiful CLI tables on terminal from multiple data sources. When I decided to learn Node/JavaScript, I decided port the library as a Node module as a good learning exercise. It took me a week and I was able to push the module to NPM. It has almost all original features plus it lets you draw tables directly from a JSON or a CSV file. Besides implementing the features, I also focused on keeping the codebase as idiomatic JavaScript as possible and writing decent documentation with as many examples as possible.</p>

<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jyotiska/prettytable">Github</a>. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettytable">Here</a> is the NPM module link.</p>

<p>Following is a sample usage taken from the project readme.</p>

<pre>
PrettyTable = require('prettytable');
pt = new PrettyTable();

var headers = ["name", "age", "city"];

var rows = [
        ["john", 22, "new york"],
        ["elizabeth", 43, "chicago"],
        ["bill", 31, "atlanta"],
        ["mary", 18, "los angeles"]
    ];

pt.create(headers, rows);
pt.print();

+-----------+-----+-------------+
| name      | age | city        |
+-----------+-----+-------------+
| john      | 22  | new york    |
| elizabeth | 43  | chicago     |
| bill      | 31  | atlanta     |
| mary      | 18  | los angeles |
